    "# Text Analytics Lab 1: Regular Expressions and Vector Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "* Be able to set up a Python and Jupyter notebook environment for text analytics.\n",
    "* Understand how to use regular expressions to preprocess text.\n",
    "* Know how to carry out text normalisation including lemmatisation.\n",
    "* Know how to obtain bigram and TF-IDF vector representations of documents and term-document matrices.\n",
    "* Be able to compute cosine similarity to compare vector representations. \n",
    "\n",

    "### How To Complete This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the text and the code then look for 'TODOs' that instruct you to complete some missing code. Look out for 'QUESTIONS' which you should try to answer before moving on to the next cell. Aim to work through the lab during the scheduled lab hours. To get help, you can talk to TAs or the lecturer during the labs, post questions to the Blackboard discussion board or on Teams, or ask a question in the lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The labs *will not be marked*. However, they will prepare you for the coursework, so try to keep up with the weekly labs and have fun with the exercises! Check the textbook (Jurafsky and Martin) for more information on the methods implemented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copilot and other AI tools\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio, we recommend switching off AI tools like Copilot while you are doing the lab. This is because the AI assistant will attempt to generate the answers for you -- sometimes it will be right, and you won't learn anything, and sometimes it will be wrong, and you'll just be confused!"

    "\n",
    "### Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using ```conda``` to create an environment with the correct versions of all the packages you need for these labs. You can install either Anaconda or Miniconda, which will include the ```conda``` program. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a .yml file that lists all the packages you will need, and the versions that we have tested the labs with. You can use this file to create your environment as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal. Use the command line to navigate to the directory containing this notebook and the file ```crossplatform_environment.yml```. You can use the command ```cd``` to change directory on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For Lab machines only (e.g., in MVB 2.11 and QB 1.80): Load the Anaconda module: ```module load anaconda/3-2024```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the conda program by typing ```conda env create -f crossplatform_environment.yml```, then answer any questions that appear on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate the environment by running the command ```conda activate text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install some libraries that are not available through Conda: ```pip install bertopic umap-learn```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make kernel available in Jupyter: ```python -m ipykernel install --user --name=text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relaunch Jupyter: shutdown any running instances, and then type ```jupyter lab``` into your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find this notebook and open it up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the top menu and change the kernel: click on 'Kernel'--> 'Change kernel' --> text_analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core libraries we will be using in this unit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/), produced by HuggingFace, is a hub for lots of interesting text datasets.\n",
    "- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org), a comprehensive NLP library.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), for machine learning and classifier evaluation.\n",
    "- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), for topic modelling.\n",
    "- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), for state-of-the-art NLP models. \n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a framework for deep learning. \n",
    "- [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart.html) for clustering documents into topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries above have good documentation, which is available either online (links above) or via Python itself, e.g. `help(numpy.array)` in the Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Refreshers for Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a refresher on Python, see the [Introduction to Python lab](https://github.com/UoB-COMS21202/lab_sheets_public/tree/master/lab_1) or the University of Bristol [Beginning Python](https://milliams.gitlab.io/beginning_python/) course. If you are a beginner with Python, you might also like to look at Chapter 1 in the NLTK book, which also provides a guide for \"getting started with Python\": https://www.nltk.org/book/. \n",
    "\n",
    "The labs will be run on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), an interactive coding environment embedded in a webpage supporting various programing languages (Python, R, Lua, etc.) through the concept of kernels. The code in a notebook is arranged in _cells_. To edit an already existing cell simply double-click on it. Cells can be run by hitting `shift+enter` when editing a cell or by clicking on the `Run` button at the top. Create new cells with the keyboard shortcut `esc` followed by `A` or `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: when you run a code cell, all the created variables, implemented functions and imported libraries will be then available to every other code cell. It is commonly assumed that cells will be run in the correct sequence and running them repeatedly or out-of-order may sometimes cause errors. To reset all variables and functions (for debugging) simply click `Kernel > Restart` from the Jupyter menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells (like this one) allow you to write fancy comments in Markdown format - double click on this cell to see the source. An introduction to Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You can also display simple $\\LaTeX$ equations in Markdown thanks to `MathJax` support: for inline equations wrap your equation between `$` symbols; for display mode equations use `$$`."

So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed.<br /><br />He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing \"thousands\" of Europeans while not affecting Africans. (I\\'d like to know real numbers but he doesn\\'t say.) Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can\\'t catch up with us. So which is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he\\'s reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It\\'s sad watch this obvious neo-Marxist contort reality to try to prove his point.',\n",

    "# 2. Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In text analytics, we aim to retrieve or extract information from text documents, or classify or summarise documents to better understand a large amount of text. Typically, we are not just looking for a single word or phrase: that can be useful for retrieving documents given a keyword query, but there are many cases where we want to recognise more complex and variable patterns. For example, if we want to find dates, we cannot list all the possible combinations of digits we want to search for, but we can look for patterns of numbers in date format. To do this, we need a way to represent the patterns we are looking for inside a piece of text. The most direct way to represent text patterns is to use regular expressions. Regular expressions provide a standard language for writing text patterns, which we will learn about below. \n",

    "# 3. Text Normalisation \n",
    "\n",
    "For most text analytics tasks, such as document classification, we will first need to transform the raw text to a suitable format for input to method such as a classifier. This process is called _text normalisation_ and is part of the _preprocessing_ stage. There are three common steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentence segmentation: this is needed when we want to process each sentence separately, e.g., to classify its sentiment. We have already tried out a basic approach to obtaining complete sentences using regular expressions. This would need to be modified to return a list of all sentences in a document. \n",
    "2. Tokenisation, in which the sentences are split into a sequence of tokens, which include words, numbers and punctuation marks.\n",
    "3. Word normalisation, in which different forms of a word are replaced by a root form. Many text analytics models, such as document classifiers, can benefit from words being _normalised_ to consistent word forms (e.g., \"dog\", \"Dog\" and \"dogs\" could all normalised to \"dog\"), as this can reduce the diversity of the vocabulary make it easier to find meaningful patterns in the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Sentence Segmentation\n",

    "You may get some errors from NLTK when you try to use sent_tokenize or word_tokenize further down. This is usually because you need to download and install some NLTK data.

    "Regular expressions are great for tasks such as finding specific patterns in text. However, it is not always possible to write a regular expression that captures all the patterns we want to find. For example, suppose we want to classify social media posts into positive and negative sentiment to see if they are favourable towards a particular famous person. We can't write down a pattern to capture all the ways of saying favourable things about that person -- it's way too diverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use machine learning to learn to recognise a wide range of patterns from a set of examples. To classify a new example, a machine learning classifier requires a *representation* of each piece of text that it can compare against the patterns it has learned. Raw text is not usually a suitable representation, and we usually need a way to turn text data into vectors -- essentially, lists of numbers. Vector representations have several advantages: for example, they map words, sentences and documents to points in a high-dimensional space, so we can learn to separate the space into different regions corresponding to classes; they allow us to compute the similarity between pieces of text by computing distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll loook at the simplest way to obtain vector representations of words and documents by constructing a *term-document matrix*. A term-document matrix has rows referring to terms, and columns referring to documents. Each element contains a count of how many times a particular term occurred in a particular document. We can treat rows as vector representations of terms, and columns as vector representations of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute term-document matrices, we need to use the text normalisation steps above. Most importantly, we need to tokenise the text into words (and other types of token) so we can count their occurrences. Normalising the words is often helpful too, as it reduces the number of rows in the matrix and makes it less sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute a term-document matrix using the CountVectorizer class from Scikit-learn. By default, this class takes raw text sequences and applies an English tokenizer automatically:"

      "foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen. We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.\n",

      "The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we were watching it for Alex Winter of \"Bill & Ted's\" fame. We didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about.<br /><br />By the time the movie was over, we knew that it was love at first sight. This movie, while not completely historically accurate, was and is the best one of its genre. I have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion, none of the others can compare. It fibbed a little at certain details, but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story. I have seen the other movies about this summer and I find most of them to be good, but none as captivating as this one.<br /><br />\"Haunted Summer\" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home. The costumes were gorgeous and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself. The whole movie was set on the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope to one day go because of seeing this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there.<br /><br />This movie shows, besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of England's harsh judgements, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal as well as recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot. It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer. And they were poets during a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudish caution. Passion and experience were a big part of the Romantic Era. And out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: \"Frankenstein.\"<br /><br />Yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at that time) played by beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is the control factor to all that goes on until she, too, gives in to experience. But she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. As was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father.<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. The music fitting. The direction captured the essence of the summer, as I've read about it. This movie was based on a wonderful book \"Haunted Summer\" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants of this story.<br /><br />If you are a person who loves history (even the little inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the birth of the monster, which even today teaches us about the morals of \"playing God.\"<br /><br />A definite must see movie!\n",

      "This series, produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second World War, is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize.<br /><br />The timing of World at War's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. Most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.<br /><br />The information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. Such names as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. <br /><br />Today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to WW2. The DVD series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price.<br /><br />I am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local TV channel aired it more than 10 years ago. It has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times.<br /><br />The highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. I think the value of this series is beyond counting.\n",

      "This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn't really made very clear. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets. The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. This is a world of relentless industrialization. It's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, 'Our Daily Bread.' 'Manufactured Landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. Some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado. But this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.<br /><br />All this happens in China, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in Bangladesh. It is backed up by music in a New Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. There are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew? It isn't made clear.<br /><br />Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer. We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow. The irony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring. He admits himself that he takes no political stand. When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer Peter Mettler, Burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. But he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.<br /><br />Logically, but not entirely fortunately, it is Burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites. Burtynsky's \"epiphanies\" may have inspired his decades of fine work, but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil, which will run out; that China has come into the game of massive industrialization late, and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel. The interest of 'Manufactured Landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. The reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of Burtynsky's work and the raw materials, the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast, awesome, daunting, and rather horrifying industrialization of modern China.<br /><br />Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title 'Manufactured Landscapes' feels insufficiently developed. It even seems a misnomer. New landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than \"manufactured.\" 'Landscapes of Waste' or 'Wasted Landscapes' might be better titles. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.\n",
