    "\n",
    "### Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using ```conda``` to create an environment with the correct versions of all the packages you need for these labs. You can install either Anaconda or Miniconda, which will include the ```conda``` program. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a .yml file that lists all the packages you will need, and the versions that we have tested the labs with. You can use this file to create your environment as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal. Use the command line to navigate to the directory containing this notebook and the file ```crossplatform_environment.yml```. You can use the command ```cd``` to change directory on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For Lab machines only (e.g., in MVB 2.11 and QB 1.80): Load the Anaconda module: ```module load anaconda/3-2024```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the conda program by typing ```conda env create -f crossplatform_environment.yml```, then answer any questions that appear on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate the environment by running the command ```conda activate text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make kernel available in Jupyter: ```python -m ipykernel install --user --name=text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relaunch Jupyter: shutdown any running instances, and then type ```jupyter lab``` into your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find this notebook and open it up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the top menu and change the kernel: click on 'Kernel'--> 'Change kernel' --> text_analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core libraries we will be using in this unit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/), produced by HuggingFace, is a hub for lots of interesting text datasets.\n",
    "- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org), a comprehensive NLP library.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), for machine learning and classifier evaluation.\n",
    "- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), for topic modelling.\n",
    "- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), for state-of-the-art NLP models. \n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a framework for deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries above have good documentation, which is available either online (links above) or via Python itself, e.g. `help(numpy.array)` in the Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Refreshers for Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip this part if you're already familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab assumes you have used Python and Jupyter Notebooks before. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction or refresher on Python, see the [Introduction to Python lab](https://github.com/UoB-COMS21202/lab_sheets_public/tree/master/lab_1) or the University of Bristol [Beginning Python](https://milliams.gitlab.io/beginning_python/) course. If you are a beginner with Python, you might also like to look at Chapter 1 in the NLTK book, which also provides a guide for \"getting started with Python\": https://www.nltk.org/book/ \n",
    "\n",
    "The labs will be run on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), an interactive coding environment embedded in a webpage supporting various programing languages (Python, R, Lua, etc.) through the concept of kernels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to enrich your code with complex comments formatted in Markdown and $\\LaTeX$, as well as to place the results of your computation right below your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are organised in cells which can contain either code (in our case, this will be Python code) or text, which can be easily and nicely formatted using the Markdown notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To edit an already existing cell simply double-click on it. You can use the toolbar to insert new cells, edit and delete them (or use keyboard shortcuts which are very handy to speed up coding). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be run by hitting `shift+enter` when editing a cell or by clicking on the `Run` button at the top. Running a Markdown cell will simply display the formatted text, while running a code cell will execute the commands executed in it. Create new cells with the keyboard shortcut `esc` followed by `A` or `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: when you run a code cell, all the created variables, implemented functions and imported libraries will be then available to every other code cell. It is commonly assumed that cells will be run in the correct sequence and running them repeatedly or out-of-order may sometimes cause errors. To reset all variables and functions (for debugging) simply click `Kernel > Restart` from the Jupyter menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells allow you to write fancy and simple comments: all of this is written in Markdown - double click on this cell to see the source. An introduction to Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Markdown is translated to HTML upon displaying it also allows you to use pure HTML: more details are available [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also display simple $\\LaTeX$ equations in Markdown thanks to `MathJax` support. For inline equations wrap your equation between `$` symbols; for display mode equations use `$$`."

      "After reading so many glowing reports of 'To Serve Them All My Days' I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something in the same league as 'Brideshead Revisited' and some of the few other great productions from British television but this is decidedly not among them. <br /><br />The characters are all too good to be true, swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye-rolling script I've heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The lead actor is interesting, mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), only dark. But his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is insufferably self-important and priggish. His prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during WW1. He does the early episodes, centered around his nervous condition, better than he does playing the the squeaky clean, socialist do-gooder later on. <br /><br />The women are completely unbelievable, as in un-real. His first wife is annoyingly chipper and chirpy, the girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated slut, and the last lady a hodge-podge of political bosh. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, named Hobarth, I forget the actor's name.<br /><br />The high-minded preachiness of the script is typical Andrew Davies, screen-writer, in his early years, and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). By episode 4 I just wanted to get through the blasted thing. <br /><br />The music is equally tedious, limited mostly to one mawkish piano tune and a chorale sung by boys during the credits. No expense was spared on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience.<br /><br />I like stories of this sort, as a rule, and am very disappointed at the maudlin nature of this series. If you want to watch something riveting about WW1 and its after-effects there are many other far finer vehicles to rent or buy. One that comes to mind is 'The Unknown Soldier' from 1998. The characters in that Masterpiece Theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one, unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in 'To Serve Them All My Days.' As for films on boys' schools stick to 'Goodbye Mr Chips' or 'Tom Brown's Schooldays'. <br /><br />I know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out $80.00 to Acorn Media for their 4 DVD set, 2 discs of which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping. 1 0\n",
      "When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. Your story would resemble \"Rocky\" because it's the only life-arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. We couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. This movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them.

Not horrible but not great. Hence it's likely to be showered with a few Oscars next year. There's nothing the Academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.<br /><br />From the New Yorker article \"Lost Boys\" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /><br />\"Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of \"Finding Neverland\" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the Llewellyn Davies family.<br /><br />\"Finding Neverland\" is a weepie. From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian. 1915George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.<br /><br />On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in \"Peter Pan\"\"that terrible masterpiece,\" in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies. 1 0\n",
      "The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov! 0 1\n",

Just look at the \"scary\" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. And it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. It certainly worked for me.<br /><br />For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you frown so heavily darling?<br /><br />If that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? Of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous!

      "While many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic I really connected with it. There is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them.<br /><br />Personally, I thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the roles being quite demanding at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I really felt nervous for them. I found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.<br /><br />The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, I have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. The creature moved well and had real menace and, although the audience I was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.<br /><br />Script-wise, I would have made a few changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem. For fans of slow-burning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately I think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed.\n",
